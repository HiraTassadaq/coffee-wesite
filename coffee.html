    <h3>what makes our coffee special?</h3>
            <p>Subsidiaries have a separate legal entity from that of their parent company. They are independent in terms of their liabilities, taxation, and governance. Thus, a subsidiary company structure can sue and be sued separately from its parent. Nevertheless, due to the majority ownership, the parent has a major say in the election of the subsidiaryâ€™s board of directors
 and its functioning. The separate legal entity of the subsidiary may help the parent company to gain tax benefits
, track the results of a unit separately, segregate subsidiary risk from the parent company, prepare assets for sale, etc.</p>
